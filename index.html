				<h2>Origins</h2>
				<p>Shavarsh Karapetyan is an armenian retired finswimmer. 9 times Soviet champion, 11 times European
				champion, and 17 times World champion in finswimming. Aged 15, he was motivated to take swimming lessons by his family after an incident in which he was thrown by bullies into a river with a rock tied around his neck. At 17, he became the national champion, but was rejected for the national team. He switched to finswimming and, fourteen months later, became the European Champion.</p>

				<h2>A hero appears</h2>
				<p>In 1974, while riding the bus to go to the swimming pool, the driver lost control of the vehicle in a winding mountain road. Shavarsh jumped into the driver's seat, took the wheel, and steered the bus away from the edge of a cliff, saving 30 lives as well as his own.</p>
				<p>The true test to Shavarsh's bravery occurred on September 16, 1976. While on a morning run near the Yerevan dam, a trolley bus with 92 passengers fell into the water, sinking to an estimated depth of ten meters. Shavarsh jumped into the murky water, broke a rear window with his feet, and performed 30 dives to retrieve the passengers, of which 20 survived the incident. His brother, Kamo, cared for the injured that shavarsh brought to the surface.</p>
				<p>After the 30th dive, Shavarsh fell unconscious. He  contracted pneumonia and a blood infection due to the exposure of his injuries to the contaminated waters of the dam. He was unconscious for 46 days after the incident.</p>

				<h2>Tried by fire</h2>
				<p>The rescue of the trolleybus passengers received no public recognition until 1982, when Karapetyan was awarded the Medal "For the Salvation of the Drowning" and the Order of the Badge of Honor.</p>
				<p>On February 19, 1985, the Soviet Armenian Sports Hall was on fire with people trapped inside. Shavarsh happened to be nearby, so he ran into the building and rescued several people. He suffered severe burns and lost consciousness due to the toxic fumes and smoke.</p>
